    "Hier auf eigene Ergebnisse eingehen und auf eigenen Datensatz!!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Von Größe her für beide geeignet 40000 Messungen, 34 Variablen nach Reinigung\n",
    "\n",
    "We have structured dataset, so logistic regression can analyze them fast\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability nach bereinigung des Datensatzes einfach, -> brauche mehr Ergebnisse\n",
    "Overfitting ist keine Sorge, was bei diesem Datensatz durchaus zum Problem werden kann (Beispiel geben!!)\n",
    "Limited to linear relationships, nach XGB classifier gibt es multilineare zusammenhänge, können damit erkannt und untersucht werden\n",
    "Mussten für XGB Daten nicht skalieren, was bei 34 Variablen von Vorteil ist.\n",
    "Wir haben gefinetuned: learning_rate': 0.1, 'max_depth': 6, 'n_estimators': 100, bei einfachem Modell nicht möglich -> Ergebnisse präziser?\n",
    "Efficiency, wie bereits bei der Auswahl des Modells erwähnt, besser als bei vergleichbaren komplexen Modellen, dennoch aufwändiger als logistic regression\n",
    "Beide haben vergleichbare Ergebnisse gegeben?!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the advantages and disadvantages of our two models have been outlined, we would like to find out which model is particularly advantageous for which stakeholder group of a hospital and under which circumstances the respective model is preferable (in everyday hospital life).\n",
    "Logistic regression is preferrable when:\n",
    "•\tThere are limited Computational Resources: Logistic Regression is computationally efficient and works in environments with constrained resources\n",
    "•\tStakeholders Require Simplicity: Stakeholders benefit from the straightforward coefficients and odds ratios provided by this model, allowing them to understand and justify predictions.\n",
    "•\tLinear Relationships Exist: When the relationship between predictors (e.g., age, medications) and the outcome (fall risk) is approximately linear.\n",
    "Stakeholder target groups for this model would primarily be people and groups who are not familiar with statistical models and who need results from models quickly. So we are talking about doctors, clinicians, hospital administrators, or decision makers.\n",
    "The model could be useful for the following applications in everyday clinical practice:\n",
    "•\tRisk Scoring: Logistic Regression can generate simple fall-risk or other risk scores for patients, which clinicians can easily interpret. A sepsis risk score for example, using data like vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure) and lab results (white blood cell count, lactate levels), helps prioritize patients for early intervention, reducing complications\n",
    "•\tDecision Support: Outputs like probabilities and feature coefficients can be integrated into electronic health record (EHR) systems to provide alerts (e.g., \"Patient X has a 70% likelihood of falling\"). Staffing plans could be adapted accordingly for higher-risk groups of people to improve care and reduce risks\n",
    "•\tEducational Tool: As it's transparent, it can be used in staff training to understand key risk factors for falls or other relevant metrics. Staff training could be more specific to real day-to-day problems/situations and therefore more useful than general training on all medically possible cases\n",
    "\n",
    "XGB-Classifier is preferrable when:\n",
    "•\tComplex and Non-Linear Relationships exist: When interactions between variables (e.g., age, mobility, medications) are not straightforward or linear.\n",
    "•\tLarger, High-Dimensional Datasets need to be analyzed: It handles large datasets with many features efficiently, allowing for complex analysis in diverse patient populations.\n",
    "•\tMaximizing Prediction Accuracy is necessary: XGB-Classifier often outperforms simpler models in terms of predictive power, especially with thorough hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "Stakeholder target groups for this model would primarily be people and groups who are familiar with statistical models and are more interested in the most accurate relations of variables in specific datasets. We are therefore talking about researchers, management and administrative staff such as the members of the Sales Department. The latter must, for example, accurately assess whether future investments or acquisitions are really worthwhile.\n",
    "The model could be useful for the following applications in everyday clinical practice:\n",
    "•\tIdentifying Multi-Factorial Fall Risks\n",
    "While logistic regression can identify general fall risk factors, XGB-Classifier can analyze complex interactions between multiple variables, such as age, medication type, comorbidities, environmental factors (like ward type), and activity logs. Therefore it is possible to use XGB-Classifier to generate granular fall-risk predictions for patients with unique, multi-dimensional profiles. Pair these predictions with intervention strategies that dynamically adjust based on real-time patient data to improve patient care\n",
    "•\tPrioritizing High-Risk Surgeries\n",
    "Unlike logistic regression, XGB-Classifier can handle non-linear interactions between risk factors for surgical outcomes (e.g., age, prior health conditions, or lab test abnormalities). This would allow to develop a pre-operative risk assessment tool to classify patients by their likelihood of complications. Surgeons could use this tool to prioritize monitoring resources or adjust surgery schedules\n",
    "•\tPreventing Adverse Drug Reactions\n",
    "Interactions between medications, genetic factors, and pre-existing conditions can lead to adverse drug reactions, which are difficult to model with linear techniques. Therefore use XGB-Classifier to predict the likelihood of adverse reactions based on patient pharmacogenomic profiles, drug combinations, and health records. Pharmacists can implement alternative medication plans or monitor flagged patients closely.\n",
    "•\tPrioritize Equipment Investments\n",
    "The XGB-Classifiers ability to handle complex relationships and large datasets makes it well-suited for evaluating multi-faceted scenarios. It helps to justify the need for additional equipment purchases in high-risk areas. It supports the development of a persuasive business case for hospital management or external funders and offers data-driven recommendations for the most effective deployment of resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there are also factors that can lead to problems when implementing the models in everyday clinical practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Challenges in Implementation\n",
    "Data Challenges:\n",
    "•\tIncomplete Data: Missing or incomplete patient records may skew predictions.\n",
    "o\tSolution: Use imputation methods (e.g., mean, median) or specialized algorithms like k-NN imputation\n",
    "o\tFor our given Dataset we used insert\n",
    "•\tImbalanced Classes: In our dataset non-fall cases were rare compared to fall cases.\n",
    "o\tSolution: Apply techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) or assign class weights.\n",
    "Operational Challenges:\n",
    "•\tIntegration with Clinical Systems:\n",
    "o\tEnsure the model is embedded in EHR systems for real-time predictions\n",
    "o\tTrain clinicians to interpret and respond to model outputs effectively\n",
    "•\tRegulatory Compliance:\n",
    "o\tAddress data privacy and security, adhering to frameworks like GDPR or HIPAA\n",
    "•\tResistance to Change: Stakeholders may be hesitant to rely on AI-driven models over traditional clinical judgment\n",
    "Stakeholder Communication:\n",
    "•\tSimplify explanations for clinical teams with minimal technical knowledge so that they can work with the model output\n",
    "•\tProvide visualization tools to present results (e.g., ROC curves, SHAP plots)\n",
    "Bias in Data:\n",
    "•\tModels trained on biased data (e.g., underrepresented groups) may lead to inequitable predictions.\n",
    "Model Maintenance Challenges:\n",
    "•\tUpdating Models: Clinical guidelines and patient demographics change over time, requiring periodic retraining of models.\n",
    "•\tMonitoring Performance: Continuous evaluation is needed to ensure that the model performs well in real-world settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "•\tLogistic Regression: Easy to implement, interpret, and deploy for immediate clinical use.\n",
    "•\tXGBClassifier: Offers superior predictive accuracy and actionable insights for high-complexity data but requires additional effort for integration and explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Identification of actionable insights derived from the models that were not already evident in the data exploration phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison to Classical Fall Risk Factors in the Literature\n",
    "These are the most common fall risk factors in no order of relevance in the Literature:\n",
    "1.\tAge: Older patients are at higher risk.\n",
    "2.\tMedication Use: Sedatives, antihypertensives, and polypharmacy.\n",
    "3.\tHistory of Falls: One of the strongest predictors of future falls.\n",
    "4.\tMobility Impairments: Difficulty walking or using assistive devices.\n",
    "5.\tCognitive Decline: Dementia or delirium increases risk.\n",
    "6.\tChronic Illnesses: Such as Parkinson’s disease or stroke.\n",
    "7.\tEnvironmental Hazards: Poor lighting, slippery floors, or cluttered spaces.\n",
    "8.\tVisual Impairments: Decreased vision can affect mobility and balance.\n",
    "9.\tDizziness or Balance Disorders: Often related to vestibular or circulatory issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in comparison with the risk factors found in the literature, we arrive at a similar result as to which factors play a role in the case of patients\n"
